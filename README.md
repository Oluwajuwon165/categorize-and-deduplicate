# Duplicate Line Removal from Categorized Text

This project aims to categorize text based on word pairs occurring at least five times in the document and then remove duplicate lines while retaining blank spaces.

## Description

This project consists of two Python scripts. The first script (categorization_script.py) categorizes text by grouping lines based on word pairs that occur at least five times in the document. The second script (deduplication_script.py) removes duplicate lines from the categorized text while preserving blank spaces.
